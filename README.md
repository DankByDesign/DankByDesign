- 👋 Hi, I’m @DankByDesign
- 👀 I’m interested in game design in the physical and digital space. I have quite a few irons in the fire but no galvanized products yet.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to program my own games. I am most recently restarting my two main projects to move away from using singleton patterns.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything! I design and am learning to program. Quite a few boardgame designs under my belt as well. I make my own art. 
   Writing stories and music are hats I enjoy wearing.
- 📫 Reach me on here I think?
